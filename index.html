          Internet</span></h2> <br>

      <p>Back in 2003, Steven Johnson <a href="#1">[1]</a> highlighted some of the major aspects of the internet by describing it as a
        city. Indeed, the web has been built and lived by many people, who have contributed to widely
        interconnect
        its different parts, yet keeping them independent. If we look closer to the form of the internet, and
        still
        analyse it through an architectural lens, It is possible to compare the building of a city to a website.
        Not
        only because both are reachable with an address, but because each building is responsible of carrying a
        story: be it cultural, historical or economical. Nevertheless, since the dimension of the internet grew
        exponentially, its spaces have been organized in a strict hierarchical structure of surveillance and
        control. Social media, for example, have become an infinite news feed ruled by <i>algorithms</i> that
        alienate the
        users in their own <i>filter bubbles</i>. Nevertheless, social media, or any other kind of tracking
        algorithms, are
        a reminder that the promise of a free internet has soon evolved into a surveillance tool. Each step we
        take
        in the digital world results into a behavioral analysis used to better match advertising to your
        character:
        a form of exploitation often referred as <i>data harvesting</i> or <i>immaterial labour</i> <a
          href="#2">[2]</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, in urban spaces, we often find politics aimed to exploit and track citizens throughout their
        lives. Here, such positions are often the trigger for actions of protest that often culminate in the act
        of
        squatting: the illegal occupation of buildings, with the aim to subvert the hierarchy by reshaping its
        structure to accommodate art, counterculture and politics, and to <i>re-appropriate social time</i> <a
          href="#3">[3]</a>. Because of its
        self-organized and autonomous nature, squats have become forms of ephemeral architecture in which the
        internal spaces change according to the needs of its inhabitants, and to the social and cultural
        initiatives
        that are taking place in it; offering an alternative to neoliberal logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of <a href="https://thewrong.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrong 2019</a>
        <a href="https://basel.codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we</a> want artists to take in
        consideration the possibility of squatting a digital
        space. Offline and online words have similar characteristics, for instance: <i>The Million Dollar Homepage</i>
        <a href="#4">[4]</a> echoes
        the rumble of Delirious New York: the lust of The City’s grid is not too far from the desire to fool the
        internet starting from just a pixel. For which reasons, we open the call for the first Basel’s offline embassy,
        inviting artists, coders, designers and thinkers to re-imagine the website as a possible space to squat.
      </p>
      <br> <br>
      <p class="highlight">What are the implications of a digital squat? How could forms of self-organization emerge
        between different users working on the same source code? Will the digital squat survive or collapse over
        internal tensions? What will this digital space be: a library, an art gallery, will it host a concert or maybe a
        screening? Will the squatter organize a digital march?
      </p>
      <br> <br>

      <p>
        Considering the internet as a country and websites its own buildings, candidates will be asked to squat our
        website, to transform and reshape it, to collaborate and debate, to build and destroy, or maybe to extend the
        squat to new domains.
      </p>

        about
        your relationship and ideas related to the topic of the call.
